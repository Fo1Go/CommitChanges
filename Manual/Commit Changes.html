                <h2>On the Subject of Commit Changes</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Should we commit it on Friday?</p>
                    <p>Module are divided into 3 sections.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A paper with notes which consists on it a repository name, contributor name and day of week.</li>
                        <li>
                            The screen with file names below, the number of which can range from 3 up to 5,
                            buttons that switch file names in cycle, and a colored LED, that can be one of two states: red, green.
                            The first file have green color.
                        </li>
                        <li>At the bottom of the module, there is a button that, when pressed, opens the console.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In order to solve the module, you must commit each file with the correct state in the correct order.
                        You can commit files using the console with Git commands (Appendix G1t).
                        Every commit must include exactly one file.
                        After all files have been committed, you must push changes to the remote repository.<br/>
                        If you are done all correct, the module will solve;
                        otherwise handle a strike, and show index of the first wrong committed file.<br/>
                        <b>Note</b>: After a strike, the module doesn't reset input. You must do it by yourself.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Initial file value</h3>
                    <p>
                        Take each character of SN, each first character of every file in number base 36 (1=1...A=10...Z=35),
                        if that symbol is not a number and not a letter, count it as 13.<br/>
                        Sum it up and modulo 64.
                    </p>
                    <h3>File value</h3>
                    <p>
                        Look at all the conditions in the table on page 2.
                        If the condition is true, take action in the column "Action".
                        +, -, *, / are math operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the file value is less than zero, make him positive. That is the final file value (FFV).
                        If the amount of files is even, sort them by his FFV in ascending order, otherwise in descending order.
                        This is the order in which you must commit files.
                        If you have the same FFV for two or more files, the first that appears on the module (going right) is preferred.

                <h3>File status</h3>
                <p>
                    Take FFV and multiply by the coefficient of initial status (Table Status coefficients).
                    If a number has any decimal numbers, discard it. Let's name it as X. Then do a bitwise XOR between X and
                    the multiplication of the repository coefficient and day of the week coefficient, modulo 2.
                    This is the file's final status.
                </p>
                <h3>Repository coefficient</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sum up all the alphabetical positions of letter in the repository's name. (A=1, Z=26)</li>
                    <li>Modulo (amount of characters multiplied by 2).</li>
                    <li>Then add 1</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Day of week coefficient</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the day of the week on the module as a row, and your real day of the week (when the bomb was launched) as a column.
                    The intersection will be your coefficient.
